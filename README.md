## 📌 Notes

This game builds on concepts from my [**game_dev**](https://github.com/mariokreitz/game_dev) repository, where I explore essential game development techniques. "Raven Hunter" brings these elements together, focusing on Canvas animation, collision detection, and dynamic effects, and lets me track how these skills evolve with each project. It’s both a practice ground and a showcase of my progress in game development.
